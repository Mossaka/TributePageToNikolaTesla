                    <h4 class="main_passage">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father of the Alternating Current, Nikola Tesla is known for his contributions to the electromagnetism, such as the AC motors and the Tesla Coil (while his name &ldquo;tesla&rdquo; is the standard unit of magnetic flux density). But this limited understanding hardly justice his legacy as an inventor. His contributions to electronics should be comparison to Thomas Edison, perhaps his biggest rival. But different from Edison, the scope of Tesla&rsquo;s work and ideas were not so limited. He had many other strange inventions, such as radio, which was not recognized as his invention because of his personal reason and other inventors.</h4>
                    <h4 class="main_passage">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nikola Tesla started his investigation of Alternating Current very early. Born in 1856 the son of Serbian family in Austro-Hungarian, Tesla had an extremely intense and pressure childhood due to the death of his older brother. His mother was a hard working woman who created many applications to help the family, such as a mechanical eggbeater, while Tesla has attributed all his inventive instincts to his mother (Tesla's Early Years, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_early.html">www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_early.html</a>). Eager to get appreciation from his father, Tesla forced himself to keep learning and thinking, demonstrating his talents in intuitiveness and pre-visioning. He discovered the concept of Alternating Current motor not until age twenty-four, and then he went to America, which he thought was: &ldquo;A century behind Europe in civilization&rdquo; (My Inventions, 49) for selling the idea. At that time, Edison dominated the electrical industry by his Direct Current. His incandescent lamp had created an astonishing demand for electric power. Most importantly, J. P. Morgan invested heavily in Edison. However, Edison knew nothing about AC motor, although Tesla had showed freely his vision of AC induction motor, none of the Edison managers were interested, because they already had a DC system and they had a lot things to do with it, as an electrical manager explained: "People generally did not at all appreciate the need or value of electricity (W. Bernard Carlson, 206)." &nbsp;(Jonnes, 98). After a short talk with Tesla, Edison immediately hired Tesla to make improvements in his DC generation plants and promised him $50,000 if he succeeded, although he never think it an impossible undertaking. After several months, Tesla announced that his work was successful completed. When Tesla asked to get $50,000 but Edison refused, saying: &ldquo;When you become a full-fledged American you will appreciate an American joke," Shocked and disgusted, Tesla immediately resigned (Coming to America, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_america.html">www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_america.html</a>). Good things happened to Tesla after he resigned, Mr. A.K. Brown of the Western Union Company agreed to invest Tesla for the AC motor. He quickly developed the system of AC power generation and transmission, saying that his dream has finally come true (Coming to America, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_america.html">www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_america.html</a> ).</h4>
                    <h4 class="main_passage">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In late 1880s, Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla were embroiled in a battle now known as the War of Currents. The direct current that Edison developed was current that runs continually in a single direction, like in a battery, but it is no easily converted to higher or lower voltages, causing the disadvantages of limited transporting within two miles (War of Currents, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_warcur.html">www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_warcur.html</a> ). However, the Alternating Current, which changes direction 50 or 60 times per second and can be converted to different voltages relatively easily using a transformer, is perhaps that best solution to this problem. Not wanting to lose the money from his direct current patents, Edison began to use propaganda and misinformation to question the safety of Tesla&rsquo; alternating current (Lantero, www.energy.gov). George Westinghouse, who bought Tesla&rsquo;s 40 basic U.S. patents and the investor of Tesla&rsquo;s alternating current recalled that Edison even had a professor who electrocuting dogs and old horses right on stage to show how dangerous alternating current was. But Tesla had the courage to vindicate that AC was safety, and at the same time revealing Edison&rsquo;s propaganda was a lie. Putting his hands on a terminal which flash electricity through his body creating a great shower, Tesla remarkably demonstrated by his own experience with his AC electricity showing that AC was not dangerous at all (Tesla, Master of Lightning). The turning point was the Chicago World's Fair. People found that it is much cheaper using Tesla's alternating current to power the Expo than using Edison's, and AC therefore became dominant in the electric power industry. From this point, nearly 80 percent of electrical devices were AC devices. Tesla and Westinghouse eventually won the War of Currents, and their partnership for the use of electricity in America had begun. &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the success of AC motors, Tesla moves on to search for a device that has higher frequencies which would save more energies. His initial goal was to create lamps of high brightness and configuration. Finally the remarkable device still known today as a Tesla Coil was invented, taking ordinary sixty-cycle per second household current and stepping it up to extremely high frequencies. In addition this creation could also generate high voltages (High Frequencies, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_whoradio.html">www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_whoradio.html</a> ). Tesla soon discovered that he could transmit and receive radio signals when they were turned to resonate at same frequency with the Tesla Coil. In 1895, Tesla could transmit a signal 50 miles, but unfortunately at the same year, a building fire destroyed all his work. In England, a young Italian experimenter Guglielmo Marconi set up long-distance successfully demonstration of wireless telegraphy, using Tesla oscillator. Although Tesla was granted his own basic radio patent in 1900, he was overconfident of them, which were not truly safe. In 1904, U.S. Patent Office surprisingly gave Marconi a patent for the invention of radio. Also at almost the same time, Marconi won the Nobel Prize in 1911, which made Tesla outrageous about it, but he had no money to against Marconi. Sarcastically after 1943 Tesla dead, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tesla's radio patent sarcastically for avoiding the Marconi Company&rsquo;s suing for using of its patents in World War I (Who Invented Radio? <a href="http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_whoradio.html">www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_whoradio.html</a> ). However, till today most of people think of Marconi as the father of radio, and Tesla is unknown for his work with radio.</h4>
                    <h4 class="main_passage">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to demonstrate the potential of wireless transmission of radio, Tesla made a performance of the world&rsquo;s first radio-controlled vessel, but his invention was too far ahead of time, causing no one realized the applications of this great invention. In 1898, the boat receives the signals to the mechanism using a small box which was described "a borrowed mind" by Tesla, with control levels on the side. As many of people were unknown the fact, considering Tesla was controlling the boat with his mind.&nbsp; This device was literally the birth of robotics, though no one realized the practical applications of this boat (Race of Robots, www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_robots.html). It was obvious that in Tesla&rsquo;s period, the world had little understanding or use for his brilliant ideas. He had imagined that his remote control could been used to military weapon developments, like a radio-guided torpedoes. But he found that no listeners until his patent had expired. The use of radio-control in military became popular was in later twentieth century.</h4>
                    <h4 class="main_passage">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Tesla was born into this new age and he helped to create. But he could not deal with this new age as it was not the way he operated. Doesn&rsquo;t like Thomas Edison or Marconi who had their own industries and companies, Tesla once finished his inventions and then sold to investors. The contribution to the AC motor and electromagnetics should give Tesla the same prestige and rewards to other great inventors, such as Thomas Edison. But Tesla, as a pure inventor different from Edison, only interested in inventing and kept moving on, leaving the AC motors, radio, remote-controlled robot and many other inventions to the world. After all, he said: &ldquo;Let the future tell the truth and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments. The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine. (Tesla, Master of Lightning)&rdquo;</h4>
